			<h1>🦉 404: Rare Bird Not Found</h1>

			<p>It seems you're trying to spot a page that's migrated to another habitat.</p>

			<p>
				Even with my best bins and field guide, I can't seem to locate what you're looking for. Much
				like that elusive warbler my kids scared away with their enthusiastic "helping," this page
				remains off your life list.
