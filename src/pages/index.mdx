# 👋 Hello, I'm<br />Ryan Morrissey

I'm a problem-solver who leads a Sales Consulting team at a large software company. My work focuses on the high tech industry, where I help my team design solutions that address our customers' unique business challenges and pain points.

Throughout my career, I've designed efficient internal staffing models, created business intelligence dashboards for senior leadership, and contributed technical solutions using our platform toolset. My greatest achievement has been building strong, creative teams who deliver exceptional results because they have the context and information they need to make good decisions.

Outside the office, you'll find me bird watching, spending time with my kids, or seeking out solace in the great outdoors.
